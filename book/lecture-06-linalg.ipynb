    "\n",
    "One of the first things we're trained to do in the chemical sciences is to balance the stoichiometric coefficients of the reactants and products in a chemical equation so that no mass is lost. For example, consider the combustion of an methane in the presence of oxygen.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "a \\text{CH}_4(g) + b \\text{O}_2(g) &\\rightarrow c \\text{CO}_2(g) + d \\text{H}_2\\text{O}(g) \\\\\n",

    "\n",
    "The game that we are taught to play is to determine the values of $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$ that make the number of atoms of each element the same on both sides of the equation. To do this, we can make a table where the two columns are for reactants (left) and products (right) and each row is for a different element. For the combustion of methane, the table looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Element | Reactants | Products |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|----------|\n",
    "| C       | $a$       | $c$      |\n",
    "| H       | $4a$      | $2d$     |\n",
    "| O       | $2b$      | $2c + d$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "From the table, we can clearly see that $a$ has to be equal to $c$ in order for the reaction to be balanced. So, we can write the table as:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Element | Reactants | Products |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|----------|\n",
    "| C       | $a$       | $a$      |\n",
    "| H       | $4a$      | $2d$     |\n",
    "| O       | $2b$      | $2a + d$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "OK, the next step is to notice that $4a = 2d$ so $d = 2a$. We can substitute this into the last row of the table to get:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Element | Reactants | Products |\n",
    "|---------|-----------|----------|\n",

    "| H       | $4a$      | $4a$     |\n",
    "| O       | $2b$      | $2a + 2a$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we can see that $2b = 4a$ so $b = 2a$. Substituting this into the last row of the table gives:\n",

We can solve this system of equations by finding the null space of $\\mathbf{A}$. The null space is the set of all vectors that send $\\mathbf{A}$ to $\\mathbf{0}$.
