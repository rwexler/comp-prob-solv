    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lecture, we will learn about control structures in Python. Control structures are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They allow us to execute certain blocks of code based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main types of control structures in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Conditional Statements\n",
    "2. Loops\n",
    "3. Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements are used to execute certain blocks of code based on certain conditions. The most common conditional statements in Python are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `if` statement\n",
    "2. `if-else` statement\n",
    "3. `if-elif-else` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 `if` statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is true. The syntax of the `if` statement is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # block of code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `condition` is an expression that evaluates to either `True` or `False`. If the condition is `True`, the block of code inside the `if` statement is executed. If the condition is `False`, the block of code is skipped.\n",

    "## 3. Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times. The most common types of loops in Python are:\n",
